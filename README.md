## OTHER NOTES
1. The application is fully responsive and has been tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and the Mobile simulator on Chrome
2. The Table view has not been built due to time but is there to show extra possibilities for the desktop.
3. More 'year' views ie. 2015, 2016 could easily be added to this application with zero code changes
4. More chart views could be added to the application with minimal and well defined changes.
